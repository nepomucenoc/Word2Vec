# Word2Vec in Python

## Introduction

This project is focused on Word2Vec, a popular natural language processing (NLP) technique used for word embedding and semantic analysis. Word2Vec helps to represent words in a vector space, allowing us to capture semantic relationships between words.

## Fundamental Concepts

Here are some essential concepts related to Word2Vec:

### 1. Word Embeddings

* Word embeddings are vector representations of words in a continuous vector space. Each word is mapped to a high-dimensional vector, where semantically similar words are located closer to each other in this space.

### 2. Word2Vec Models

* Word2Vec is an unsupervised learning algorithm that learns word embeddings from a large text corpus. There are two main architectures for Word2Vec:
  * **Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)**: Predicts the target word using the context words surrounding it.
  * **Skip-Gram**: Predicts the context words from the target word.

### 3. Semantic Relationships

* Word2Vec captures semantic relationships by finding similarities between words based on their vector representations. Words with similar meanings have similar vector representations and appear close to each other in the vector space.

### 4. Pre-trained Word Embeddings

* Pre-trained Word2Vec models trained on massive text corpora are available. These models can be loaded and used in NLP tasks without retraining.

### 5. Python Libraries

* Python provides libraries, such as Gensim, spaCy, and others, that make it easy to train Word2Vec models and use pre-trained embeddings.

### 6. Applications

* Word2Vec is used in various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, document classification, recommendation systems, and more. It can also be used to find similar words or discover word analogies.

## Implementation

To use Word2Vec in Python, you can follow these steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare your text corpus for training or analysis.
2. **Training**: Train a Word2Vec model using a Python library like Gensim.
3. **Word Embeddings**: Extract word embeddings from the trained model.
4. **Semantic Analysis**: Analyze semantic relationships between words using the embeddings.
5. **Applications**: Use the learned embeddings for your specific NLP tasks.
